# About

**The project aims to implement the correct code on Laravel,
design patterns, and implement the functionality
of the application through the main features provided
by the Laravel framework. This project focuses more on 
functionality rather than appearance.**

3. **Migrate database and seeds** (run in your terminal _php artisan migrate:refresh --seed_).

4. **Go to your local server or run in your terminal** _php artisan serve_ **and enjoy!**
